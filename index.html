        <p>Born and raised in rural Illinois, I graduated high
          school and started college in the nearby college town
          of Terre Haute, Indiana. There I completed my Bachelor's
          of Science in Medical Technology. I interned at a
          hospital just outside of Chicago where I performed and
          ran laboratory tests ordered by physicians and nurses
          at area hospitals. Tired of the cold and harsh winters,
          I applied and was accepted as a United States Naval Medical
          Service Corps Officer in the United States Navy.
          For officer training school and indoctronation, I was
          sent to the Naval Training Center in Newport Rhode Island.
          From there, I was stationed in San Diego, California for
          one four year tour. I left the Navy after one tour and
          lived in San Diego for about 10 years before I moved to
          Atlanta. While in Atlanta, I went back to school and
          received another Bachelor's of Science in Network
          Communications and Engineering. With my combined
          experience as a Medical Technologist and a Network
          Engineer, I have been working for a Medical Device/Biomedical
          company here in Atlanta for the last 8 years. This position
          has allowed me to travel the world and work with citizens
          from various countries and cultures. Now, I am working
          on gaining experience and becoming a full stack developer
          where it will hopefully help me push my career forward
          to new and different areas of my life and work.</p>
